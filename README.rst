Seashore provides a shell abstraction
for easy automation of UNIX commands in Python.
The primary interface to many common tools is the command line;
for example, :code:`git`, :code:`apt-get`, and :code:`yum`.
Even when there is an equivalent Python library --
such as :code:`docker` and :code:`docker-py` --
often a shell script needs to be quickly ported one-to-one.
Seashore helps in these cases by being able to write a
clean, simple, and testable Python API wrapper around
these tools.
